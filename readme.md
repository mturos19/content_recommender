This is a simple content-based recommender engine in python


Traditional content-based falls short as it doesn't drive incremental sales. The classic scenario of Harry Potter books, where someone searching for Book 1 is also recommended Book 2 and generates a sale. This might look good but it's not, the model didn't drive an "incremental" sale. 

Incremental sales are unexpected items that are purchased via a complex relationship. Harry Potter books and brooms for examples or HP books and round glasses.
